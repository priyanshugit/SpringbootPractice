What is Lambda Expression?

Lambda is a anonymous Function
    -No Name
    -No Modifier
    -No Return Type
Lambda expression can only be used with functional interfaces.
Lambda expression can not be used with simple interface

Benefits of Lambda
-Reduces line of code
-Sequential and parallel execution support by passing behaviour ad a argument in methods.
-To call APIs very effectively
-To write more Readable, Maintainable and concise code.

Important Rules of Lambda
-If the body of Lambda Expression contain only one statement then curly braces are optional.
-Java compiler also infer the type of variable passed in arguments, hence type is optional.

Functional Interface?
If the interface contains only one abstract method then it is a functional interface.
Ex : Runnable, Callable, Comprable etc.

To call Lambda we require functional interface.
Lambda is used to implement functional interface in very simple and short manner.
